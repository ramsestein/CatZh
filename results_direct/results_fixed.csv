Okay, the user is asking if diamond is the hardest mineral on Earth. I need to recall the hardness values. Diamonds are known for being extremely hard, right? I remember that the Richter scale measures hardness, and diamonds have a hardness of 10 on that scale. Other minerals like ruby or emerald have lower numbers. So the answer should be yes.
